# STCANetViz

## Overview
STCANetViz is a web-based visualization tool designed to optimize the STCANet model, a deep learning model for ocean currents prediction. STCANet leverages the intricate nesting and coupling of two primary modules, the Spatial module and the Attention temporal module forming a complex system to forecast oceanic surface currents.
