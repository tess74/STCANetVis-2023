# STCANetViz

## Overview
STCANetViz is a web-based visualization tool designed to optimize the STCANet model, a deep learning model for ocean wave prediction. STCANet leverages the intricate nesting and coupling of two primary modules: the Spatial module and the Attention temporal module. These form a complex system to forecast oceanic waves with high precision.
